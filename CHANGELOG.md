## v0.8.10 2025 08 25

### Changed

- The `phpUpdater` regex has been updated to better handle version replacements.
- The regex for content replacement in the manifest update has been improved.
- The build process has been enhanced with source maps, license generation, and minor documentation formatting.
- `README.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` have been updated with action inputs.

### Added

- Sourcemap and `index.js` are now included in the `dist` folder.

### Fixed

- Improved version handling and regex replacements in updaters.

## v0.8.2 2025 08 24

### Fixed

- Corrected version handling to preserve 'v' prefix in `versionUtil.ts`.
- Updated `regexReplace` patterns in `dockerUpdater.ts` to correctly replace only the version string.
- Updated `regexReplace` patterns in `pythonUpdater.ts` to correctly replace only the version string.

### Added

- Implemented automatic release branch creation and pull request generation for version bumps.

### Changed

- Updated `README.md` and `DEVELOPER.md` to include comprehensive details about GitHub Action inputs from `action.yml`.

## v0.8.1 2025 08 24

### Added

- Added `target_path` input to specify the working directory for version bumping.

## v0.8.0 2025 08 24

### Changed

- Moved `UpdaterRegistry` to `src/registry` for better organization and updated all relevant imports.
- Applied Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) by passing `FileHandler` as a dependency to `ManifestParser`, and `ManifestParser` as a dependency to updaters. This improves testability and flexibility.
- Defined more granular error classes (`FileNotFoundError`, `InvalidManifestError`) within `errors.ts` to enable more precise error handling and user feedback.
- Updated `FileHandler` and `ManifestParser` to throw these specific errors, and `index.ts` to catch and handle them.

- Enhanced version bump action with explicit platform and git tag control:
  - Added `target_platform` input to `action.yml` allowing users to explicitly specify the platform for version bumping, bypassing automatic detection.
  - Modified `UpdaterService` to use the `target_platform` if provided, otherwise fall back to existing detection logic.
  - Updated `index.ts` to read and pass `target_platform` to `UpdaterService`.
  - Implemented conditional Git tag creation based on the `git_tag` input from `action.yml`.
- Introduced custom error types for granular error handling.

### Changed

- Encapsulated Git operations in a `GitService`.
- Extracted version calculation to a separate utility.
- Introduced `UpdaterService` for dependency injection.
- Extracted Git operations into a separate utility.
- Centralized file handling operations by introducing a new `FileHandler` utility. This improves consistency and maintainability across different updaters.
- Centralized manifest parsing and updating logic by introducing `ManifestParser` utility and updating all updaters to use it.
- Updated `dist/index.js` after centralizing action configuration.

### Fixed

- Corrected NodeUpdater tests by ensuring manifestPath is set.

## v0.7.3 2025 08 24

### Changed
