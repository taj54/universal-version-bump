## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover any security-related issues, please report them to us immediately.

**Please do NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, please email your findings to [tajulislamj200@gmail.com](mailto:tajulislamj200@gmail.com).

When reporting, please include:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigations (if you have them).

We will acknowledge your email within `5` business days and aim to provide a more detailed response within `10` business days.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you practice responsible disclosure by not disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping our project secure.

Thank you for helping to keep this project safe for everyone.
